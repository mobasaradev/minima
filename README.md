#### Management of Minima Note

- BLoC pattern: 
 Utilizes Bloc and Cubit for efficient state management, allowing for separation of business logic from UI components.
- HydratedCubit:
 Implements local storage using HydratedCubit, ensuring persistent data storage and retrieval, even across app restarts.
- MVC architecture:
 Adheres to the MVC architecture for clear separation of concerns, with models representing data, views handling UI, <br>
 and controllers managing the interaction between the two.

With this management approach, Minima Note achieves streamlined state management, reliable data storage, and a well-structured codebase. The combination of BLoC and Cubit enables reactive updates and easy testing, while HydratedCubit ensures data persistence. The MVC architecture promotes code organization and maintainability, making it easier to understand and modify the app's components as needed.
